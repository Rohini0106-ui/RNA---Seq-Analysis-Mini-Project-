# RNA---Seq-Analysis-Mini-Project-
This project investigates the transcriptomic changes in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) by analyzing RNA-sequencing data from human pancreatic islet samples (GSE86468). Using a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline implemented in R, including DESeq2 for differential gene expression analysis, the study identifies significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with T2DM. Functional enrichment reveals key pathways involved in insulin signaling, inflammation, and structural cell maintenance. The findings highlight a dominant downregulation of genes related to cellular architecture, suggesting that T2DM impacts more than metabolism by compromising cell integrity. Several DEGs emerge as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, paving the way for precision medicine approaches tailored to molecular subtypes of diabetes.
